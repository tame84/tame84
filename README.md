# Hey üëã

I'm tame, welcome to my Github profile !

## My life üåç

I'm a young Belgian web developer specialized in React.js passionate about discovering new aspects of the languages I use. I learned my skills by myself with the documentation and video series available on the web. I started to get interested in React again towards the end of 2023 (even though I didn‚Äôt post my code on github during that time).

Since the end of June 2024 I try seriously to practice my skills with a rhythm of one code moment per day. I‚Äôm also learning Three.js in order to create sites that stand out thanks to 3D.

At the moment, the goal is not to make code my work, it‚Äôs just a passion I have.

## My Skills üíª

Here are the languages I know and can work with right now, Eventually I would like to add Next.js and other frameworks/new libraries used to make a website dynamic and pleasant to use.

## My Certifications üèÜ

As said above I am self-taught and therefore do not have a diploma. I took the time to make some certifications available on the web. You can check in the list below what I have validated to make an idea of what I know how to do.
