# Hey ! my name is tame ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile ! I hope you will enjoy what you're going to see.

## My life

A young Belgian developer specialized in React.js passionate about discovering new aspects of the languages I use. I learned my skills by myself with the documentation and video series available on the web. I started to get interested in React again towards the end of 2023 (even though I didnâ€™t post my code on github during that time).

Since the end of June 2024 I try seriously to practice my skills with a rhythm of one code moment per day. Iâ€™m also learning Three.js in order to create sites that stand out thanks to 3D.

At the moment, the goal is not to make code my work, itâ€™s just a passion I have.

## My Skills

Here are the languages I know and can work with right now, Eventually I would like to add Three.js and other libraries used to make a website dynamic and pleasant to use.
